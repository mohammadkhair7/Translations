Translations of Arabic Islamic Books

These books are samples of automated translations using OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini LLM Model.

Large Language Models (LLM) can be useful tools for translating Islamic literature written in Arabic into several languages, making this complex task technologically feasible, providing high quality translations, at low cost and high-speed production enabled by parallel computing. We applied LLM-driven translation automation on a diverse corpus of Islamic scholarly works including: the Qur’an, Quranic exegesis (Tafseer), Hadith, and Jurisprudence from Al-Shamela library. More than 250,000 pages have been translated, emphasizing the potential of LLMs to cross language barriers and increase the global access to Islamic knowledge. OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini model was used for the forward translation from Arabic to English with acceptable translation quality.
